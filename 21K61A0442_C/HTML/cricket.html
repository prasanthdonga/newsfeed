        NEW DELHI: Nearly 11 months after limping off the field, Jasprit Bumrah will be the centre of attention when he captains India against Ireland. The three-match T20 International series, which begins in Dublin on Friday, will put the fast bowler's stamina and fitness to the test.
        Ruturaj Gaikwad, Rinku Singh, and Jitesh Sharma are among the many Gen-Next IPL stars on the team, but many involved in Indian cricket will be closely watching Bumrah since he will be crucial to the home team's strategy during the ODI World Cup, which begins in less than two months.
        After having surgery to repair lower-back stress fractures he had sustained during a home series against Australia before the T20 World Cup last year, the 29-year-old Bumrah is making a comeback.
        Despite the fact that he will only <strong>bowl a maximum of 12 overs over the course of three games spread over five days, this series will give chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar, ODI captain Rohit Sharma, and head coach Rahul Dravid a good notion of the Gujarat slinger's match fitness.

        However, in 50-over cricket, he must bowl 10 overs over the course of two, three, or possibly four periods.
        The BCCI posted Bumrah's bowling video on its official social media account. It showed him hurriedly bowling a right-hander with a disguised short ball and then nearly yorking a left-hander with a toe-crusher.
        However, the circumstances of the match would be quite different, and both Dravid and Rohit have already burned their hands by hurrying him before the T20 World Cup in Australia last year.
        The outcomes were terrible. That was the final series Bumrah participated in before his seven-year international career's longest break.
        Earlier this year, Bumrah was selected for a home series but was forced to withdraw at the last minute due to surgery to treat an ailment that could have ended his career.</p>
