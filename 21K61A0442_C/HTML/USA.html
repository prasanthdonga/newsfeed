    <h3><strong>USA education system</strong></h3>
    
    <p>
        
        <img src="USA.jpg"class="centered-image">

        Education is mandatory until age 16 (18 in some states). The government provides free public education through high school. In Arkansas, kids typically go to school from mid-August through mid-May.

Because Children International partners with the school district in Little Rock, our sponsored children are typically enrolled in school. But impoverished children in Arkansas face other barriers to education:

Increased child hunger. When kids are hungry, they can’t learn and are more likely to have behavioral problems and worse overall health outcomes. In Arkansas, 23.2% of kids are food-insecure.
Lack of stable housing. <strong>Research shows a lack of stable housing can be harmful to children’s physical and mental health, their ability to succeed in school, and may increase their likelihood of juvenile delinquency.</strong>
Less access to quality early education. This puts them at a disadvantage compared to their more affluent peers. <br>If students aren’t able to catch up to their peers’ reading skills by third grade, they are four times more likely to drop out before graduating high school.
